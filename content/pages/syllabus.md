## Course Overview

This undergraduate lecture course provides a comprehensive introduction to the making of U.S. foreign and national security policy. Over the course of the semester, we will examine the laws that guide policymaking, study the actors and organizations involved in the interagency process, and develop a deeper understanding of how the interaction between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches shapes policy development and implementation. The course draws heavily from theories of international relations and security studies. To more deeply explore how the policymaking process plays out, most classes will feature a historical or contemporary case study.

Throughout the semester, students will read primary source documents and analysis written by political                 
scientists, historians, and policymakers; engage with course materials during class discussions; and acquire hands-on experience in national security policymaking and analysis through writing and a multi-day crisis simulation.

The seminar is designed for undergraduate students interested in international relations, security studies, and public policy, although no background knowledge in political science is required.

## Course Policies

*Mutual Respect*

Although opinions on the topics covered in the course may differ, mutual respect is critical to a successful seminar. Students are expected to arrive to class on time, actively listen to their classmates, and critically (but respectfully) engage with their classmates, instructor, and the assigned readings.

*Academic Integrity*

All students will uphold the highest standards of academic integrity. Presenting the work of others (e.g., ideas, specific phrases, etc.) as your own is considered plagiarism, and will not be tolerated. Moreover, the use of any generative AI is not permitted in this course. Any violations will be handled according to MIT policies, which are outlined at {{% resource_link "95255ca7-cc89-46ec-8a6e-af3cb99a5b2f" "Academic Integrity at MIT: A Handbook for Students" %}}.
